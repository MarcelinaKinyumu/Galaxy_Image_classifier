# Galaxy_Image_classifier
A Deep Convolution Neural Network (DCNN) model that classify galaxy images in to either spiral  or elliptical with a test accuracy of 98%.
In this project, we used the kaggle Galaxy Zoo dataset to traing the Neural Network with images that have a probality percentage fraction greater than 0.8 in either of the two classes that representes our categories of interest.

The main kaggle notebook that includes output can be found using the link below: https://www.kaggle.com/marcelinakinyumu/galaxy-morphology. The most updated link to the updated version of the git notebook https://github.com/MarcelinaKinyumu/Galaxy_Image_classifier/blob/main/galaxy-morphology.ipynb.
